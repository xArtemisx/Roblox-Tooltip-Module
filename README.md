# Roblox-Tooltip-Module
A quick and simple Roblox Lua (LuaU) based ToolTip Module

I created this because there was no other easy to use OOP based tooltip modules with the ability to insert and edit any arbitary number of TextLabels. This system achieves all of that, although admittedly it's not good for much else. The ideal way to use this is by creating your own Templates folder inside of the module with the various preconfigured text labels/other entry types you need, however there's a method that creates a default text label as well as tooltip box when simply using the "Default" arguments.
